    • Open the project in your prefered code editor. 
    • Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code) 
    • Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal) 
In the first terminal
    • cd client and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.

    • Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID in your .env file 
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
